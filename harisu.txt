SMART BROWSER
Smart browser is a webbrowser that was developed by harisu fanyui a student
from  the faculty of engineering and technology university of buea as a project which was mentored
by our lecturer mr.Ngatchu Damen this browser was developed using a Gtk 
i faced some challanges at the very beginning of the project as it seemed almost
impossible from my point of view but with the courage i went into 
it and after sometime i started seeing feasibilities in what our lecturer really
meant when he said we should developed a webbrowser
although the browser can search the web it cannot store the pages and as can be seen by any
one who has brows with it. It has it shortcomming and i intern to continue developing the browser
adding new features such as browsing by using photo and encoporating an antivirus into it so that it 
takes care of any malware that might affect the user's machine during his/her browsing with this browser. 


personally i have gain the experience of working 
on a real life project.during the course of the project i learnt alot of things 
because of the challanges that i encountered an i went on to do extra studies in order
to solve the problem.
great thanks goes to our lecturer because he has made me developed personal skill that do not only apply
to the browser project but skills that i can use in building other application as well.
i am really impressed to see what i can do and was able to do with the browser development not widstanding 
it's a sign for me to used my elastic brain and do more.
